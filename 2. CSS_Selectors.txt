1) Element Selectors- It selects a particular HTML tag.
   
   h1{
    color: blue
   }

2) Class Selector-  It's used for grouping elements in your HTML file to apply the same CSS rule to all of them.
                    It allows you to group different parts of your HTML file into having the same styling.
                    And this can be really, really useful on multi-page websites with lots of different elements,
                    and you don't just want to select a particular type of HTML element.
   //styles.css
   .red-heading{
    color:red
   }

   //index.html
   <h2 class="red-heading">Red</h2>
   <h2>Green<h2>
   <p class="red-heading">Blue</p>

3) Id Selector- this selects all elements with a particular ID attribute.

   //index.html
   <h2 id="main">Red</h2>
   <h2>Green</h2>
   <h2>Blue</h2>

   //styles.css

   #main{
    color:red;
   }
   
    The class selector can be applied to many elements, whereas the ID should be only applied to
    one element in a single HTML file

4) Attribute Selector- We can select these elements that have particular attributes or particular attributes values by
                       using this notation.
   
   //index.html
   <p draggable="true">Red</p>
   <p draggable="false">Green</p>
   <p draggable="false">Blue</p>

   
   //styles.css

   p[draggable="false"]{
    color:red;
   }

5) Universal Selector-  When you apply this, it doesn't matter what class you've got, what ID, what attribute set, which different elements,
                        if you select all, it's going to apply the style to everything where the stylesheet is active.  

    *{
        color:red;
    }
