Types of CSS:-
1) Inline- It goes into the same line as a particular HTML element.
  
   <html style="background: blue">    //Property: value
   </html>

    It's not normally recommended to use inline styles in your entire document.
    It's only for specific sections, or when you're testing, or when you only want it in one single element
    or one line in your HTML document.

2)  Internal- Internal styles are really useful for applying it only to one HTML document.
    
    <html>
    <head>
    <style>
    html{
        background: red;
    }
    </style>
    </head>
    </html>
    }

 3) External- This style of external CSS is what's used most commonly in web development.

    //index.html
    <html>
    <head>
    <link
     rel="stylesheet"   // relationship- refers to what is the role of this thing that we're linking to.
     href="./styles.css" // location
     />   
     </head>

     //styles.css
     html{
        background:green;
     }
